    <p>  Kobe Bryant is an all-time great. He deserves to have the title of the GOAT. 
      He is better than Jordan and LeBron. </p>

    <p>LeBron James lacks what Kobe and MJ had: The Clutch gene, the killer instict. LeBron has this tendancy to pass in situations where he cleary has an advantage in many situations. This leads to losses in big games which have effected his legacy. MJ and Kobe desired thos positions because they are killers and can kill at will Lebron just doesn't have that in his game</p>

    <p> There is a prime example of LeBron Passing up moments where he can close the game. Kobe and MJ are known for closing out cames. Ask the Utah Jazz (MJ's Last Shot)</P>
